## Notes

Tyler Fox, [@smileyborg@mas.to](https://mas.to/@smileyborg/110498103080905700):

> 💥 A small but mighty addition to UIKit this year is a new `UIViewController` callback named [`viewIsAppearing(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/4195485-viewisappearing)
>
> It’s very similar to `viewWillAppear(_:)`, but called at a much better time in the lifecycle ✅
>
> And it back-deploys to iOS 13 🤯
